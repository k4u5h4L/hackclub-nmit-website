[**Hack Club**](https://hackclub.com/) is a global, nonprofit network of high school makers & student-led coding clubs. And, the [**Hack Club NMIT**](https://hackbout.tech) is its official student chapter. We condcut regular [Workshops](https://github.com/hackclubnmit/workshops), which are self-led learn-to-code tutorials, you can find our [Code of Conduct](https://hackclub.com/conduct/) here. In a nutshell, we are the movement of students building the classes we wish we could take!

## Philosophy

We think learning to code is uniquely like gaining a superpower: it converts you from a _consumer_ to a _creator_, turning your computer into a tool for creation. If you’re reading this, you can learn to build an app—there’s never been a better time for making.

**The goal of Hack Club is to help you become a hacker.** We want an inclusive space on the internet & at every school where people are making interesting things with code, every week. In our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/gpkg9zW) , you can ask coding questions, you’ll meet amazing friends, share projects you’re building, and so much more. Most members start out with little to no coding experience, build projects of their own and attend & later organize amazing in-house hackathons like [HackBout](https://hackbout.tech).

## History

Hack Club was founded by [Zach Latta](https://zachlatta.com) who dropped out of high school because the school system wasn’t working. We’re an entirely open source organization—[our website](https://github.com/hackclub/v3) to even [our finances](https://bank.hackclub.com/hq) are public. It’s backed by everyone from [Elon Musk](https://hackclub.com/elon/) to GitHub co-founder Tom Preston-Werner. With the help of Hack Club HQ team, our club founder [Anurag Singh](https://anuragsingh.dev) and co-founder [Rachet Mudnur](https://github.com/rachetm) started [**Hack Club NMIT**](https://hackbout.tech) along with a strong team of 10 core members in the year 2019 at [Nitte Meenakshi Institute of Technology](https://nmit.ac.in), Bangalore, India. Since then we are trying to give our best to the Hack Clubbers community.
